Shawn Mendes is having what he describes as the “coolest year ever.” That might be an understatement.

This summer alone, he released a new music video, received a Teen Choice Award nomination for Best Male Artist, and is currently opening on Taylor Swift’s 1989 Tour.

Yep, Shawn’s doing a lot of smiling these days — and he’s spreading the happiness to others! The heartthrob just launched his [Notes From Shawn](https://www.dosomething.org/campaigns/notes-shawn?source=node/1141) campaign with DoSomething.org for the second year in a row.

Last year, 53,349 young people sneakily plastered their communities with 257,033 uplifting messages for strangers. Research shows compliments like these boost self-esteem and decrease the risk of self-harm. As Shawn told us, you don’t have to be having the “coolest year ever” to brighten someone’s day.

Here, the music star answers some of our questions about why he’s writing so many notes!

#### Why did you create the Notes From Shawn campaign?
After seeing so many of my fans and friends dealing with depression and bullying, I really felt I needed to do something to help. It’s really important to me, and I felt with the power of such amazing fans we could really make an impact by just doing simple things to improve and better people’s days one by one. Last year we saw so much support for the campaign that I felt it was only right to bring it back.

#### What would you tell young people to get them involved with the campaign?
I’d tell them that even the SMALLEST things go such a long way when you’re helping others. This campaign is all about the little things. Things as simple as posting a note with “You’re amazing” scribbled on it can really can turn someone’s whole day around.

#### If you could write a note (from Shawn!) to your fans and young people around the world, what would it say?
“Every single one of you guys ROCK! Don’t stop being yourself and don’t stop loving yourself for who you are!”

#### Why do you enjoy working with DoSomething.org?
From the very first time I met everyone at DoSomething, we clicked. We shared a common goal that’s all about helping spread positivity and making an impact.
