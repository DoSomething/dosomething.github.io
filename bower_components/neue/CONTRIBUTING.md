# Contributing
Neue was built for our internal needs at DoSomething.org, but it could also work for your organization. Feel free to fork this repository and use it as a starting point for your own website and style guide.

The latest version of the pattern library is always available online at [neue.dosomething.org](http://neue.dosomething.org/).

## Getting Started
You can also run the pattern library on your local machine! Here's the steps:

  1. Clone this repository.
  2. Run `bower install`, `bundle install`, and `npm install` to configure dependencies. Yikes.
  3. Run `grunt` to build CSS and JS from source (and watch for changes).
  3. Run `rackup` to start the server (or just link to Pow).
  4. Check it out in your browser!

Check the [Deployment](https://github.com/DoSomething/neue/wiki/Deployments) page on the wiki for instructions to deploy a new version of the Pattern Library.

## Code Guidelines
Code guidelines for SCSS and JavaScript can be found as a `README` within their respective directories in the repo. We also use [SCSS-Lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint) and [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) to keep our code neat and tidy.
